    """
    Base class for models which cannot switch beam particles arbitrarily.

    Calls to Model.cross_section and Model.__call__ are executed
    in a separate process with a fresh instance of the underlying generator
    to work around initialization issues.

    If the parameter timeout is set to zero or negative values, the remote
    control feature is disabled. This may be required when you want to run
    the models in parallel in a Notebook with joblib, and possibly elsewhere.

    # This is a big hack, but required until a proper solution is available.
    #
    # Generating events is optimized, the process is kept alive during generation and
    # sends its events via a queue to the main process. In an exception occurs in the
    # child process, it is passed to the main process and raised there.
    #
    # Sending of data may use pickle (seems to be platform dependent) and should have some
    # overhead. This penalty only matters for event generation, where the performance drop
    # could be noticable. We could avoid this by allocating EventData in shared memory.
    #
    # To maintain the illusion that we are pulling events from a model instance instead of
    # restarting it repeatedly, we must roundtrip the state of the random number generator
    # everytime we create a new process. So this functionality relies strongly on correct
    # RPNG state persistence.
